Sessions ended by the agent (\`lavish-axi end\`) reopen normally without the flag.\n`,
    poll: `Usage: lavish-axi poll <html-file> [--agent-reply "..."]\n\nThis command long-polls indefinitely for queued user prompts. It stays silent while it waits - that is normal, never kill it. Browser-detected layout issues do NOT return this poll: they are filed passively in the user's Layout issues inbox and arrive as an ordinary tag "layout-warnings" prompt only after the user selects them and queues the fixes. Warning lifecycle: an issue stays unresolved and counted while queued, becomes recurring if a newer artifact revision still shows it, and is resolved only after a newer artifact load plus a complete diagnostic pass at the same viewport no longer detects it. A failed or incomplete pass preserves it as unverified rather than clearing it.

    export: `Usage: lavish-axi export <html-file> [--out <path>]\n\nWrite a portable copy of an artifact: one HTML file with its LOCAL assets inlined (relative-path stylesheets, scripts, images, and fonts become inline <style>/<script> blocks and data URIs). Remote CDN/font references (https URLs) are left as links for the browser to load, so the file needs network to render those. Lavish makes no outbound requests - it only reads local files, confined to the artifact's directory. Defaults to writing <name>.export.html next to the source; pass --out to choose a path. The Lavish annotation SDK is never included in an export.\n`,
    share: `Usage: lavish-axi share <html-file> [--password <pw>] [--token <t>]\n\nPublish only when the user explicitly asks to share or publish the artifact outside the local machine. This command sends the artifact to ht-ml.app (https://ht-ml.app), a third-party hosting service not part of Lavish, and prints a visitable URL. Shares are PUBLIC by default: anyone with the link can open the page, and it may be indexed or scraped. Pass --password to publish a PRIVATE password-protected page; viewers must supply the password to view. Builds the same local-inlined HTML as 'export' (local assets inlined; remote CDN/font URLs left as links and are not blocked by CSP on ht-ml.app, but still load over the viewer's network), then POSTs it to ht-ml.app's /v1 API. Creating a site needs no account or API key. The response includes the url plus a secret update_key (shown once) for updating or deleting the page later. Set LAVISH_AXI_HTML_APP_TOKEN (or pass --token) to attach an optional bearer token; it is never required. The annotation SDK is never included.\n`,
    stop: `Usage: lavish-axi stop [--port <port>]\n\nShut down the background Lavish Editor server. The server also stops itself when no browser or poll has been connected for a while (LAVISH_AXI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS, default 30m) and immediately when the last session ends with nothing connected.\n`,
    playbook: `Usage: lavish-axi playbook [playbook_id]\n\nList focused artifact guidance playbooks, or show one playbook by ID.

    design: `Usage: lavish-axi design\n\nShow a copy-pasteable CDN snippet for Tailwind CSS browser runtime v4 + DaisyUI v5 + themes, Mermaid diagram tooling, a content-to-playbook router, an optional layout safety CSS snippet, plus technical reference for DaisyUI components. ${PLAYBOOK_ROUTER_HELP} Lavish artifacts stay portable HTML. This CDN snippet is the design fallback, not the default: inspect the subject project before falling back, and paste the layout safety CSS only when useful for dense nested grid/flex layouts, badges, wide fonts, or local media. ${DESIGN_PRIORITY_RULE}\n`,
    setup: `Usage: lavish-axi setup hooks\n       lavish-axi setup plugin\n\nhooks: install or repair agent SessionStart hooks for lavish-axi ambient context in Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and GitHub Copilot CLI. Restart your agent session afterward to receive the context. This is the primary integration - it carries live session state.\n\nplugin: register the installed lavish-axi package as an Agent Plugin (agent-plugins.org) in VS Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot CLI. The installed package directory is itself the plugin root, so nothing is downloaded and no marketplace is involved. Reload each client afterward. Codex users should use \`setup hooks\` instead.\n\nBoth actions are explicit opt-in, idempotent, and repair a stale path after a reinstall.\n`,
    server: `Usage: lavish-axi server [--port 4387] [--verbose]\n\nRun the local Lavish Editor server. Pass --verbose (or set LAVISH_AXI_DEBUG=1) to log session and watcher events to stderr. Detached server output is appended to ~/.lavish-axi/server.log, or LAVISH_AXI_STATE_DIR/server.log when set, for startup and crash diagnostics.\n\nLAVISH_AXI_HOST sets the bind address (default 127.0.0.1; a wildcard 0.0.0.0 or :: binds every interface). Binding beyond loopback exposes an unauthenticated server that can read and serve arbitrary local files to anything that can reach it, so only do so on a trusted network. LAVISH_AXI_LINK_HOST sets the hostname written into generated session links (default: the bind address, or loopback when bound to a wildcard). See README's Allowed hosts section for Host allowlisting and LAVISH_AXI_ALLOWED_HOSTS. LAVISH_AXI_NO_OPEN=1 (or --no-open) suppresses the local browser launch.\n`,
