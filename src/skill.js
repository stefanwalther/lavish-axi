# Lavish Editor

${skillCommandText(home.description)}

You do not need lavish-axi installed globally - invoke it with \`npx -y lavish-axi <html-file>\`.
If lavish-axi output shows a follow-up command starting with \`lavish-axi\`, run it as \`npx -y lavish-axi ...\` instead.

## Request

$ARGUMENTS

If the request above is non-empty, the user invoked \`/lavish\` explicitly - build an HTML artifact for that request now, following the workflow below.
If it is empty, infer what to visualize from the conversation.

## When to use

${home.help[home.help.length - 1]}

## Workflow

1. Create the HTML artifact (default location \`.lavish/<name>.html\` in the working directory).
2. Run \`npx -y lavish-axi <html-file>\` to open or resume a review session in the browser.
3. Run \`npx -y lavish-axi poll <html-file>\` to long-poll for the user's annotations, queued prompts, and browser-reported \`layout_warnings\`.
   On the first poll, prefer \`--agent-reply "<one-line summary of what you built and what to review first>"\` so the conversation panel opens with context.
   The poll stays silent until the user acts or the real browser reports fresh layout warnings - leave it running, never kill it.
   If your harness limits how long a foreground command may run, run the poll as a background task; if it gets killed or times out anyway, just re-run it - queued feedback is never lost.
4. If poll returns \`layout_warnings\`, follow the returned \`next_step\`: fix and re-check fresh error-severity findings, but proceed with a note instead of looping when every current warning is persistent or low-severity.
5. Apply human feedback, then poll again with \`--agent-reply "<message>"\` to reply in the browser and keep the loop going.
6. Run \`npx -y lavish-axi end <html-file>\` when the review is finished.
7. If the user ends the session from the browser instead, \`npx -y lavish-axi <html-file>\` refuses to reopen it and says so - only pass \`--reopen\` when the user asks for further review or something genuinely important needs their visual attention. Otherwise deliver remaining updates directly in this conversation.

## Visual guidance

${bullets(home.visual_guidance)}

## Playbooks

Run \`npx -y lavish-axi playbook <id>\` for focused, detailed guidance on any of these.
${PLAYBOOK_ROUTER_HELP}
For flows, architecture, state, or sequence diagrams, do not hand-build boxes-and-arrows from div/flexbox; open the diagram playbook and use the theme-aware Mermaid snippet from \`npx -y lavish-axi design\` unless SVG is needed for richly annotated nodes.
