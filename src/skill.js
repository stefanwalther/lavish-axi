# Lavish Editor

${home.description}

Use the \`lavish-axi\` command available on PATH. A managed environment may provide this command as a pinned wrapper around a reviewed package version.
If \`lavish-axi\` is missing, stop and tell the user the local Lavish CLI is not installed; do not fall back to \`npx -y lavish-axi\` unless the user explicitly asks to run an unpinned package.

## Request

$ARGUMENTS

If the request above is non-empty, the user invoked \`/lavish\` explicitly - build an HTML artifact for that request now, following the workflow below.
If it is empty, infer what to visualize from the conversation.

## When to use

${home.help[home.help.length - 1]}

## Workflow

1. Create the HTML artifact (default location \`.lavish/<name>.html\` in the working directory).
2. Run \`lavish-axi <html-file>\` to open or resume a review session in the browser.
3. Run \`lavish-axi poll <html-file>\` to long-poll for the user's annotations, queued prompts, and browser-proven severe layout failures returned as \`layout_warnings\`.
   On the first poll, prefer \`--agent-reply "<one-line summary of what you built and what to review first>"\` so the conversation panel opens with context.
   The poll stays silent until the user acts or the real browser proves meaningful content is inaccessible or unusable - leave it running, never kill it.
   Cosmetic, intentional, transient, tiny, and uncertain observations remain silent.
${POLL_WAKE_PATH_RULES.map((rule) => `   ${rule}`).join("\n")}
4. If poll returns \`layout_warnings\`, follow the returned \`next_step\`: repair the severe failure and re-check it before involving the human.
5. Apply human feedback, then poll again with \`--agent-reply "<message>"\` to reply in the browser and keep the loop going under the same foreground-or-verified-wake-path rule.
6. Run \`lavish-axi end <html-file>\` when the review is finished.
7. ${POLL_SEND_AND_END_RULE} Deliver any remaining updates directly in this conversation.

## Visual guidance

${bullets(home.visual_guidance)}

## Playbooks

Run \`lavish-axi playbook <id>\` for focused, detailed guidance on any of these.
${PLAYBOOK_ROUTER_HELP}
For flows, architecture, state, or sequence diagrams, do not hand-build boxes-and-arrows from div/flexbox; open the diagram playbook and use the theme-aware Mermaid snippet from \`lavish-axi design\` unless SVG is needed for richly annotated nodes.
