HTML is the new markdown. Lavish is the new editor for your HTML artifacts.

Agents are good at producing rich HTML artifacts, but the human-agent collaboration loop on such artifacts is lacking and falls back into screenshots and long responses for “tell me what to change.”
That loses the thing HTML is best at: interactivity.

Lavish Editor opens agent-generated HTML files in a local browser, lets you pinpoint elements and selected text, edit rendered Mermaid diagrams as whiteboards, and send feedback to the agent to address.

- **Local-first** - Review local HTML artifacts with a local CLI and no cloud dependency in the core feedback loop; hosted sharing through third-party ht-ml.app is explicit and opt-in.
- **Human-AI collaboration** - Annotate elements and selected text ranges, edit Mermaid diagrams as whiteboards, and send messages to the agent without leaving Lavish Editor.
- **Battery included** - Lavish Editor teaches your agent good visualization for common use cases such as product or technical plans, design explorations and more out of the box.

Lavish Editor is an [AXI](https://axi.md), which means -

- It's just a CLI any capable agent can run without setup.
- It's optimized for agent ergonomics. TOON output, long polling, and contextual disclosure making it highly token efficient.
- The skill and hooks below only handle discovery; agents learn to use the AXI by using it.

## Quick Start

Install the Lavish skill in the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format with [`npx skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```sh
npx skills add kunchenguid/lavish-axi --skill lavish
```

The skill teaches your agent to run Lavish through the `lavish-axi` command on `PATH`; a managed environment may provide it as a pinned wrapper around a reviewed package version.
If `lavish-axi` is not installed, the skill tells the agent to stop and say so rather than fetch an unpinned package.
The skill frontmatter stays within the Agent Skills standard so it works across shared harnesses.
This installs the public `lavish` skill.
The repository also contains an internal `lavish-design` brand skill for maintainers; default `npx skills add ... --list` and skills.sh discovery hide it unless `INSTALL_INTERNAL_SKILLS=1` is set.

Then, in agents that expose skills as slash commands (Claude Code, for example), invoke it directly:

```
/lavish let's discuss our plan here
```

Or just ask for anything that is easier to grasp visually - a plan, comparison, diagram, table, code view, or report - and the agent loads the skill on its own when it recognizes the task.

By default the skill lands in the current project's skills directory (`.claude/skills/`, for example); add `-g` to install it for all projects (`~/.claude/skills/`).

## Other Ways to Use Lavish

The skill is the recommended path, but it is not the only one.

### Zero setup

Lavish is an AXI, so any capable agent can run the CLI directly with nothing installed at all.
Just tell your agent:

```
Use `npx -y lavish-axi` to write a product or technical plan for what we discussed.
```

### Session hook

Want Lavish's ambient context - including your live open sessions - fed into every agent session instead of loading on demand?
Install the CLI globally and opt into the hook:

```sh
npm install -g lavish-axi
lavish-axi setup hooks
```

This installs a `SessionStart` hook for **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **OpenCode**, and **GitHub Copilot CLI** that surfaces open sessions, visualization playbooks, and usage guidance at the start of each session.
Unlike the skill, the hook also shows your live open sessions, so a fresh agent session can resume an in-flight review.
**Restart your agent session after running this** so the new hook takes effect.

### Agent Plugin

Lavish also ships as an [Agent Plugin](https://agent-plugins.org) - the vendor-neutral packaging standard for skills and MCP servers - so clients that speak that format can load it directly.

**No marketplace is involved.** The installed npm package _is_ the plugin: `plugin.json` sits at the package root next to the `skills/` directory, so whatever `npm install` already put on disk is a complete, conformant plugin. Install the CLI, then register it:

```sh
npm install -g lavish-axi
lavish-axi setup plugin
```

That registers the installed package with every supported client it finds - **VS Code**, **Cursor**, and **GitHub Copilot CLI** - and reports which ones were absent. It is opt-in and idempotent, and it repairs the registered path after a reinstall or relocation. Reload each client afterward.

Each client is registered independently: one that cannot be registered is reported with what to do about it, and never blocks the others or fails the command.

To register by hand instead, point any client at the package directory (`npm root -g`/`lavish-axi`):

| Client             | Register with                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| VS Code            | `"chat.pluginLocations": { "<package-dir>": true }` in user settings                                               |
| Cursor             | link the package dir at `~/.cursor/plugins/local/lavish-axi` (`setup plugin` handles Windows link compatibility)   |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `copilot plugin install <package-dir>` (or `copilot plugin install kunchenguid/lavish-axi` straight from the repo) |

Codex and ChatGPT install plugins only from marketplace sources, so Codex users should use the session hook above instead.
Lavish declares no MCP server - the CLI itself is the agent interface - so a plugin install brings the same `lavish` skill, and the skill and plugin are alternatives rather than a stack.

```

- **File-path identity** - Sessions are keyed by the canonical HTML file path, so agents do not need opaque IDs.
- **Portable artifacts** - The artifact runs in a sandboxed iframe while Lavish injects a small SDK for annotations, snapshots, feedback controls, and render-time layout checks.
  Author-defined links and popups can open in top-level tabs, while artifact documents remain sandboxed without same-origin access.
  Lavish does not inject any design system, so the saved HTML file renders identically whether you open it through `lavish-axi` or directly in a browser.
  Run `lavish-axi design` for the single source of agent-facing design guidance and optional CDN or Mermaid snippets.
- **Self-paint warning** - `lavish-axi <html-file>`, `export`, and `share` run a render-free check for artifacts missing an explicit page background and return a one-line `self_paint_warning`.
  The check fails open - any stylesheet link, `@import`, Tailwind runtime script, `color-scheme`, or `html`/`body`/`:root` background signal suppresses it - and it never blocks the open.
- **Open-time layout gate** - The browser chrome masks an artifact only while the real in-iframe audit waits for fonts and final geometry.
  The first completed check reveals the artifact, whatever it found, unless the mask is naming one of the failures below; the gate never holds the review hostage waiting for a repair.
  The user can click **Show anyway**, and a bounded safety timeout fails open when no check has completed.
  If the review cannot load at all - the chrome's own script never runs, or the server does not answer the artifact's load request after several retries - the mask is replaced by a message naming the problem and a **Check and reload** button, instead of holding the artifact behind a check that will never complete.
  A review already loaded in another browser tab is named the same way, with a **Take over here** button that moves it into the current tab, because Lavish loads an artifact in one tab at a time.
- **Layout issues inbox** - Detection is passive. After fonts and finite animations settle, the injected SDK confirms severe failures from direct rendered evidence such as materially escaped meaningful content or required controls, clipped text fragments, viewport reachability, or near-total semantic occlusion.
  Explicit ellipsis and line clamp, standard visually hidden accessibility text, intentional scrollers or masks, parent overhang, generic element scroll geometry, decorative overlap, and uncertain motion do not produce findings by themselves.
  Proven failures are filed in a **Layout issues** button in the top bar, which is hidden while nothing is unresolved and otherwise shows the unresolved count.
  Its drawer lists each issue with severity, a plain-language explanation, the affected viewport, the target/component identity, when it was last seen, and its lifecycle state, plus per-issue **Reveal** (highlight it in the artifact) and **Dismiss** actions.
  Nothing is selected by default. The user picks issues (or **Select all**) and **Queue selected fixes** turns that whole group into one ordinary queued prompt, tagged `layout-warnings`, that reaches the agent through the normal feedback path when they send.
  Detection never returns `lavish-axi poll` and never wakes an agent; only the user queueing a fix does. The one exception is a fatal `artifact_failures` response, for failures that make the review itself unusable, such as the artifact document or one of its own local assets failing to load.
- **Layout issue lifecycle** - Each issue is identified by a stable fingerprint of the diagnostic rule, the normalized target identity, and the viewport class, so repeat detections update one record instead of inflating the count.
  `Open` means the latest completed check for its viewport still detects it. `Queued for fix` means the user asked for a repair - it stays unresolved and counted, and cannot be queued again while that request is outstanding.
  `Resolved` requires a newer successful artifact load plus a complete check at the same viewport that no longer detects it; it then leaves the count but keeps a bounded history.
  `Still present` (recurring) means a queued issue survived a newer revision, so it is selectable again with its earlier attempt retained. `Unverified` means a reload or check failed or was incomplete, so the prior issue was preserved rather than cleared. `Returned` means a resolved issue came back on a later revision.
  Dismissal applies only to the current artifact revision; a later revision surfaces the issue again if it is still detected. A check at one viewport never clears an issue found at another, and a viewport removed from the configured diagnostic set (`LAVISH_AXI_DIAGNOSTIC_VIEWPORTS`, default all) is marked obsolete with an explicit reason rather than reading as fixed.
- **Local assets** - Copy local images, CSS, fonts, and scripts next to the HTML artifact and reference them with relative paths from that directory; root-prefixed paths such as `/assets/logo.png` will not resolve through Lavish's artifact route.
- **Export and sharing** - `lavish-axi export` writes `<name>.export.html` by inlining local assets only, stripping the annotation SDK, and leaving remote CDN/font references as links that still need network access.
  `lavish-axi share` publishes the same local-inlined HTML to [ht-ml.app](https://ht-ml.app), a third-party hosting service not part of Lavish.
  Publishing sends the artifact to ht-ml.app's servers, public by default, or private and password-protected with `--password`; the response includes a secret `update_key` shown once for later management.
  Bundling never fetches remote URLs, the export adds no CSP of its own, local reads stay confined and size-capped, and absolute `file://` paths outside safe inlined asset references are redacted before output.
  Per-asset and per-bundle inline caps default to 10 MB and 25 MB, overridable with `LAVISH_AXI_EXPORT_MAX_ASSET_BYTES` and `LAVISH_AXI_EXPORT_MAX_BUNDLE_BYTES`.
  Unresolved local assets or export notices such as author-set CSP meta tags and redacted file URLs are surfaced in command or browser output.
  Use `--token` or `LAVISH_AXI_HTML_APP_TOKEN` for an optional bearer token; set `LAVISH_AXI_HTML_APP_API_URL` to override the ht-ml.app API base and point `share` at a backend you control (see [Self-hosting the share backend](docs/self-hosting-share.md) for the contract it must implement).
- **Live reload** - Lavish watches the HTML artifact file by default and preserves review context across reloads: the artifact iframe scroll position, an open annotation card's unsent text, and answers to `data-lavish-question` controls (application-owned form state is left alone). Unsent annotation text also survives a full reload of the review page itself. While a queued layout-issue batch is outstanding, closely spaced saves coalesce so one batch of fixes costs one refresh. To also reload on sibling asset changes, add `data-lavish-live-reload-root` to the root element or `<meta name="lavish-live-reload" content="root">`.
  If the element an unsent annotation was attached to is gone from the artifact for good, Lavish cannot reopen that card, so it writes your text into the conversation panel under **Unsent annotation** - selectable, never written over anything you have typed, and kept there across reloads; no note is ever dropped to make room for a newer one, and a note the browser refuses to store says so where it is shown.
- **Feedback controls** - Native controls (radios, checkboxes, inputs, selects, buttons, labels, disclosure summaries, contenteditable) are interactive automatically, so they do not need `data-lavish-action`.
  For reversible choices, let option clicks update local state, then queue exactly one final answer from a per-question submit or Queue answer button with `window.lavish.queuePrompt()`.
  Mark only custom (non-native) clickable elements with `data-lavish-action` so Lavish does not annotate them, and use `data-lavish-question` or `queueKey` when pre-send updates for the same question should replace each other.
  Queued annotation preview pills and chat history share a scrollable Conversation panel above a sticky composer, so long feedback queues do not push the text box or send controls off screen.
  The browser chrome keeps editing actions in the overflow menu (copy path, reload artifact, copy DOM snapshot, export standalone HTML, publish link, end session), while the composer exposes **Send & End** beside **Send to Agent** to submit queued prompts and user-ended attribution together.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - In the chrome composer, Enter sends queued prompts and Shift+Enter inserts a newline.
  In the annotation card, Enter queues the annotation, Shift+Enter inserts a newline, and Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on macOS) queues it and sends all queued prompts immediately.
  Cmd+I or Ctrl+I toggles between annotate and explore mode from either the browser chrome or the artifact iframe, including while focus is in a textarea or control.
- **Agent presence** - The browser shows when no agent is listening, keeps queued feedback for the next successful `lavish-axi poll` send even across reloads, and keeps human feedback actions available while the agent is working because the server queues them for the next poll. The agent's reply (`--agent-reply`) concludes delivered work and returns presence to waiting.
  The no-timeout poll always writes an immediate stderr banner so it is visibly not hung; it adds the periodic stderr wait ticks only in an interactive terminal, so when stderr is piped (as under agent harnesses) the captured output carries no tick noise. Stdout always stays reserved for the final response; if the poll is interrupted or times out before feedback arrives, re-run it because feedback remains queued until delivery. Poll delivery consumes the response, so read the complete response before truncating or filtering it.
  Codex-specific guidance keeps that poll attached to the active turn instead of hiding it in a background task, because completed background tasks may not resume the agent.
- **Session end etiquette** - Lavish tracks who ended a session: a human clicking **End session** (or **Send & end session**) in the browser is a user-initiated end, while `lavish-axi end <html-file>` is agent-initiated.
  A plain `lavish-axi <html-file>` after a user-initiated end refuses to reopen the browser and returns guidance instead; pass `--reopen` only when the user asks for further review or something important needs their visual attention.
  Agent-initiated ends keep reopening normally, same as before.
  `lavish-axi poll`'s `ended` response and the `feedback` response for the final batch before an end both carry `next_step` guidance telling the agent to stop polling and deliver remaining updates in chat instead of reopening.
- **Precise targets** - Text annotations include selected text plus range anchors, and text selections carry those anchors only.
  Clicking an element inside a table also carries the cell's visible row and column names alongside the exact CSS locator, so filtered or sorted rows do not make feedback look misdirected.
  When merged cells make either name ambiguous, Lavish leaves that name out rather than guessing; an explicit `<th scope="row">` remains authoritative even when a `rowspan` makes the row's position ambiguous.
  The CSS locator still points at the exact element you clicked, so an annotation with an omitted name is only less descriptive, never mislabelled.
- **Image attachments** - Attach reference images (PNG, JPEG, WebP) in either the Conversation composer or an annotation card by pasting, drag-dropping, or using its image picker; each image shows a thumbnail chip with upload, remove, retry, and error states.
  A paste containing both text and images preserves the text while attaching the images (a copied file's own name or path is treated as placeholder and not pasted). Conversation messages may contain text and images together or images only.
  Images are stored under the state dir and the queued prompt carries a server-generated absolute `path` and content-hash `id` (plus mime and dimensions) - never the raw bytes - so `lavish-axi poll` hands the agent a local file path to open.
  Limits are `LAVISH_AXI_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` (default 10 MiB per image), `LAVISH_AXI_MAX_ATTACHMENTS_PER_PROMPT` (default 4), and `LAVISH_AXI_MAX_PROMPT_ATTACHMENT_BYTES` (default 25 MiB per prompt); if any image is missing or any prompt breaches a count or byte cap, the entire send batch is rejected, the queue is preserved, and the reason is surfaced in the composer rather than silently dropping images.
  As a browser-side abuse guard, each chrome page allows 30 upload attempts per rolling minute, 4 uploads in flight at once, and 256 MiB of attempted image bytes over its lifetime; rejected uploads stay visible for retry or removal.
  Attachments are cleaned up by `LAVISH_AXI_ATTACHMENT_TTL_MS` (default 7 days; `0`/`off` disables) but only once no pending prompt still references them; `LAVISH_AXI_MAX_ATTACHMENT_DISK_MB` (default 512 MiB; `0`/`off` disables) caps total attachment disk.
  The cap is enforced when an image is uploaded, not just periodically: the upload first reclaims unreferenced files (oldest first, and never one added within the last hour), and if it still would not fit, that upload is refused with a storage-full error on its chip instead of discarding an image the user is about to send.
- **Mermaid diagrams** - In the Lavish browser, every rendered Mermaid diagram in a `.mermaid` container becomes an embedded editable Excalidraw whiteboard.
  Click a diagram to unlock editing, and use its Fullscreen action to edit it over the whole viewport.
  Whiteboard scenes autosave locally.
  If a live reload changes the Mermaid source, an unmodified whiteboard silently re-converts to the new diagram. If the reviewer had edited the scene, reopening it lets them re-convert and discard the saved edits or keep editing the saved scene.
  Use **Queue feedback** to add a bounded edit summary plus local `.excalidraw` scene and PNG preview paths to the Conversation panel, then click **Send to Agent** to deliver it.
  The agent updates the artifact's Mermaid source, which remains authoritative.
  Flowchart, sequence, class, ER, and state diagrams convert to editable shapes; other diagram types are images that reviewers can draw and annotate.
  Lavish changes only the browser view, so saved, standalone, and exported artifacts still render plain Mermaid.
- **Server cleanup** - The detached server stops after the last session ends when nothing is connected, or after `LAVISH_AXI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30 minutes) with no browser or poll connections.
  Set `LAVISH_AXI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=0` or `off` to disable idle self-shutdown.
- **Server upgrades** - One background server serves every session, so upgrading `lavish-axi` while reviews are open makes the next `lavish-axi <html-file>` replace that server. Only the review page for the artifact being opened reloads itself once the replacement answers - and not even that one while you have unsent annotation text open, which gets the same banner instead so the reload is yours to make. Every other open review page keeps working and shows a banner reading "Lavish was updated. This page is running the previous version.", with a Check and reload button and a Dismiss button, so no page you are reading reloads on its own. After `lavish-axi stop` those pages say Lavish was stopped and to reload after you start it again, and a restart that only picks up a local build says that rather than claiming an update.
  Every **Check and reload** control asks the server whether it is running before it navigates; while nothing answers, the page stays where it is and says so, and a check that gets no answer at all says that instead of guessing.
  In-flight `lavish-axi poll` commands end with an interrupted-poll error and are safe to re-run; queued feedback is never lost, and annotation text you have typed but not queued yet survives the reload as described under **Live reload**.
  A page waits for the replacement rather than reloading into a port nothing is listening on, and tells the user to restart Lavish if it never returns.
- **Local-first state** - Session state stays under `~/.lavish-axi/` by default, or `LAVISH_AXI_STATE_DIR` when set.
- **Diagnostic viewports** - `LAVISH_AXI_DIAGNOSTIC_VIEWPORTS` sets which viewport classes the layout-issue inbox tracks (`mobile`, `compact`, `desktop`; comma-separated, default all). Warnings whose class leaves the set are marked obsolete with an explicit reason instead of silently reading as fixed.
- **Server port** - Set `LAVISH_AXI_PORT` to choose the server port; it defaults to `4387`.
- **Network binding** - The server binds to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) by default. Set `LAVISH_AXI_HOST` to bind elsewhere; a wildcard (`0.0.0.0` or `::`) binds every interface. Binding beyond loopback exposes an unauthenticated server that can read and serve arbitrary local files to anything that can reach it, so only do so on a trusted network. Set `LAVISH_AXI_LINK_HOST` to control the hostname written into generated session links (defaults to the bind address, or loopback when bound to a wildcard).
- **Allowed hosts** - To defend against DNS rebinding, the server rejects (`403`) any request whose `Host` header is missing or not one it answers to: the loopback names (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`) plus the configured bind and link host. If you reach the server under another name - a wildcard bind accessed by LAN IP, a reverse-proxy hostname, or an extra interface - list those names in `LAVISH_AXI_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (whitespace-separated) to allow them. Behind a reverse proxy, the forwarded `X-Forwarded-Host` is validated against the same list, so add your public hostname there and have the proxy send it together with `X-Forwarded-Proto`. Set `LAVISH_AXI_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to `*` to disable the check entirely (only when the server sits behind your own authentication or proxy). Mutating routes also reject a present foreign `Origin` or `Referer` (`403`); header-less CLI control requests remain allowed where supported.
- **Browser opening** - Set `LAVISH_AXI_NO_OPEN=1`, equivalent to `--no-open`, to create or resume a session without launching a browser window.

| `lavish-axi end <html-file>`    | End a session as the agent; unlike a user-initiated end from the browser, this still allows a plain reopen later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `lavish-axi export <html-file>` | Write a portable copy of the artifact: one HTML file with its local assets inlined, so it opens with no server and no sibling files. Remote CDN/font references are left as links.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `lavish-axi share <html-file>`  | Publish the artifact (local assets inlined) to [ht-ml.app](https://ht-ml.app), a third-party host not part of Lavish, and print a visitable URL plus a secret update key; shares are public by default, and `--password` makes viewers enter the password before viewing.                                                                    |
| `lavish-axi stop`               | Shut down the background server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `lavish-axi playbook [id]`      | List focused artifact guidance or show one playbook; agents must open each matching playbook before writing HTML.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `lavish-axi design`             | Show agent-facing design guidance, including optional CDN and Mermaid snippets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `lavish-axi setup hooks`        | Install or repair optional SessionStart hooks for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and GitHub Copilot CLI; restart the agent session afterward.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `lavish-axi setup plugin`       | Register the installed package as an [Agent Plugin](https://agent-plugins.org) in VS Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot CLI; opt-in, idempotent, no marketplace involved. Reload each client afterward.                                                                                                                                        |
| `lavish-axi server`             | Run the local Lavish Editor server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Known playbook IDs: `diagram`, `table`, `comparison`, `plan`, `code`, `input`, `slides`.
One artifact often combines several playbooks, such as a plan that includes a comparison and a diagram, so agents must match against each `use_when` trigger and open every matching playbook before writing HTML.
For flows, architecture, state, or sequence diagrams, open the diagram playbook for the recommended tooling and SVG guidance.

| `lavish-axi <html-file>` | `--no-open`           | Ensure the server/session exists without opening another browser window.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `lavish-axi <html-file>` | `--no-gate`           | Skip the open-time layout curtain for this browser open.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `lavish-axi <html-file>` | `--reopen`            | Reopen a session the user explicitly ended from the browser; without it, a plain open refuses and explains why instead of reopening uninvited.                                                                                      |

| `lavish-axi export`      | `--out <path>`        | Write the export to a specific path instead of `<name>.export.html` next to the source.                                                                                                                                             |
| `lavish-axi share`       | `--password <pw>`     | Make the third-party ht-ml.app page private; viewers must supply the password.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `lavish-axi share`       | `--token <t>`         | Attach an optional bearer token (`LAVISH_AXI_HTML_APP_TOKEN`); never required to publish.                                                                                                                                           |
| `lavish-axi poll`        | `--agent-reply "..."` | Show the agent's reply in the existing browser chat, conclude delivered work, and return presence to waiting before polling again.                                                                                                  |
| `lavish-axi poll`        | `--timeout-ms <ms>`   | Test/debug escape hatch only; agents should normally omit it and leave the long poll running.                                                                                                                                       |

| `lavish-axi server`      | `--verbose`           | Log session and watcher events to stderr; can also be enabled with `LAVISH_AXI_DEBUG=1`. Detached server output is appended to `~/.lavish-axi/server.log` (or `LAVISH_AXI_STATE_DIR/server.log`) for startup and crash diagnostics. |
